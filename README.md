# project-mgmt-graphql-apollo
Web app with GraphQL, Express  and Vue

This project is based on the project [project-mgmt-graphql](https://github.com/bradtraversy/project-mgmt-graphql), for which I watched the video crash-course by Brad Traversy [project-mgmt-graphql](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcLNfwF04Kw&t=9094s) 

For practice purposes, I want to reprogram it with Vue.js and Node.js.
